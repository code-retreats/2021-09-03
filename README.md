# ElixirStarter

[![CI](https://github.com/krishnan-mani/elixir_starter/actions/workflows/elixir.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/krishnan-mani/elixir_starter/actions/workflows/elixir.yml)

This project serves as a "starter" configured with a few dependencies to help with writing code in Elixir and run tests.
These include:
- run tests "on change"
- code coverage
- code readability

Fork it to your account on GitHub, and use as you wish.

## Workspace

Obtain a fully functional and ready-to-use remote workspace on [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to work on the project you fork. To do so, simply construct a URL consisting of "https://gitpod.io/#" + the URL to your repository on github, and navigate to it in your browser. For example, ```https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/krishnan-mani/elixir_starter```

This repository already contains a basic [.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml) configuration, so your workspace will have Elixir installed, and a couple of VSCode extensions for Elixir.
